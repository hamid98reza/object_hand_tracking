# object_hand_tracking
a fast object tracking using opencv  accompanied with hand tracking. 

This is a simple code of delegating mediapipe three dimensional hand tracking and object detection in opnecv.

Here we track objects based on hsv colors and contour area , we have hand landmarks with width,height and depth.

It can be used in multiple scenarios in computer vision specially when concerning latencyðŸš€ and accuracyðŸ”Ž furthermore 
hand acclusions has been compensated in hands landmarks for instance we can detect 
the objects are picked by someone with  alittle bit modification.
